Whope is the Sioux goddess of peace, harmony, and friendship.

As a divine mediator, Whope gifted humans the sacred Pipe, symbolizing peace and teaching them the Seven Sacred Rites. According to the legend, she once appeared as a beautiful young woman dressed in white, bringing sacred knowledge and rituals to the people, including the ceremony of using the peace pipe to communicate with the Great Spirit.
